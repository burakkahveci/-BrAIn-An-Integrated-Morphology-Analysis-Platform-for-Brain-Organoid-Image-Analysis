# 🧠 BrAIn: An Integrated Platform for Brain Organoid Image Analysis

Classification • Segmentation • Object Detection – No Code GUI for 2D Organoid Morphology

### 📌 Overview

BrAIn is the first open-source tool to unify classification, segmentation, and detection tasks for brain organoid imaging. Designed to support both research and diagnostic workflows, BrAIn empowers users with:
	•	💡 Multi-task analysis from a single interface
	•	🖼️ Morphological feature extraction: budding, folds, neuroectodermal structures
	•	🧪 Tested on both synthetic and real datasets
	•	🖱️ No-code GUI for users with no programming background
